# Dockershame

This project will create a k8s cluster in your machine using virtualbox as your hypervisor
and it will be fully automated via kubeadm, ansible and vagrant. The default scenario will deploy
one master node and 2 workers, but it can be easily escalated as long as you have the hardware
resources to do so. The default container runtime is containerd but it can be changed to CRI-O.

Everything was tested on a machine running Archlinux, but theoretically it will work on a variety
of other platforms as long as the minimum requirements are satisfied.

## Getting Started

Once you've fulfilled the requirements, just clone the project, move to its root and run:

```
$ vagrant up
```

### Prerequisites

The general requirements to get this project running are ansible, virtualbox and vagrant.

### Installing

```
# Ansible
$ sudo pacman -S --noconfirm --needed ansible sshpass

# Virtualbox
$ sudo pacman -S --noconfirm --neded virtualbox virtualbox-host-modules-arch virtualbox-guest-iso
$ yay -S virtualbox-ext-oracle

# Vagrant
$ sudo pacman -S --noconfirm --needed vagrant

$ vagrant up
# Once cluster done, you can list the VMs
$ vagrant status

# You can then ssh into each node
$ vagrant ssh master
$ vagrant ssh worker1
$ vagrant ssh worker2

# Inside the master's terminal
# you can list all pods in all namespaces
# to verify everything is running as expected
vagrant@master:~$ kubectl get no
vagrant@master:~$ kubectl get po -A
```
